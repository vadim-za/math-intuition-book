The book presents various math topics by "rediscovering" them, focusing on intuitional and motivational aspects of mathematical thinking, and is supposed to complement technical university-level math courses. The text includes materials on calculus of one and several variables, linear, tensor and exterior algebra, ordinary linear differential equations as well as Fourier transform. For students and graduates of technical engineering universities.
